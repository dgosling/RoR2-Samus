# IMPORTANT

- This does nothing on without other mods. Please don't download this on its own and complain to me unless you really want to.

- Join the BadAssEmotes/EmotesAPI discord https://discord.gg/3kXkVkNDxs

- If you are unsure how to do animations, go to Settings->ModSettings->CustomEmotesAPI. From here you can customize your emote wheels and see keybinds.

## WIKI

- I have set up a wiki which should be more organized and in-depth than this readme has been previously
