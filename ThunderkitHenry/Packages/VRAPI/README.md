# Add VR compatibility to your mod!
This API allows for simple interactions with the VR mod and its features.

## For mod developpers:
You can create custom hands for your character by importing the [RoR2VR Devkit unity package](https://github.com/DrBibop/RoR2VRMod/releases) into a ThunderKit project.

The documentation for the API and the devkit can be found in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/DrBibop/RoR2VRMod/wiki).

You can also watch the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAvCVBah7RrLYmnEVApu4PqIdi3tXI4YT) once they are available.
